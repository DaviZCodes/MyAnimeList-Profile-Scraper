The MAL API is great. I can use it to fetch the user's animelist and mangalist without authentication. However, it is missing some features.

I am not able to retrieve the user profile and a lot of information without authentication. In addition, most users do not want to authenticate to a website that they have not used before.

Thus, I have decided that web scraping the public MyAnimeList (MAL) pages is the best option to obtain that information.
